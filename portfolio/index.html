                <p>I was raised in Hopewell, New Jersey, and currently reside in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I currently work as a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.gm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Motors</a> out of Warren, Michigan.</br></br>
                    During my past 2 years at GM, I have gained significant experience in backend web development. Working in the Digital EV Commerce space, I developed a process to automatically generate European vehicle registration documents, a process previously done manually per vehicle. I recently participated in a company hosted Hackathon competition, where my team placed 2nd and won an award for most innovative.</br></br>
                    Prior to employment at GM, I worked with a multinational company to verify Windows 10 compatibility of their 1,000+ desktop applications. I have also interned as an intranet manager, overseeing a company's <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jive</a> instance.</br></br>
                    I am a recent graduate of the <a href="https://www.engin.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Michigan College of Engineering</a>, where I received a B.S.E. in Computer Science as well as a Minor in Statistics in December 2020. My time at Michigan led me to develop interests in computer networking, operating systems, and data modeling. The most challenging project I accomplished during my time there was implementing a thread library from scratch (it had me banging my desk many times). I also was the vocal percussionist and PR manager for <a href="http://www.maizemirchiofficial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maize Mirchi A Capella</a>.</br></br>
                    In my personal life, I enjoy making music and traveling. I most recently visited San Francisco (picture left!)</p>
