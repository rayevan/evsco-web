            <p>I am a recent graduate of the University of Michigan College of Engineering, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science as well as a Minor in Statistics.</br></br>
            My time at Michigan led me to develop interests in computer networking, operating systems, and data modeling. The most challenging project I accomplished during my time there was implementing a thread library from scratch (it had me banging my desk many times). My most recent project involved designing a functional static router.</br></br>
            In the workforce I have served as a software test manager, where I worked with end users within a company to verify the compatibility of 1,000+ desktop applications with Windows 10. I have also interned as an intranet community manager, overseeing a company's Jive instance.</br></br>
            In my personal life, I enjoy making music, singing, and beatboxing. I currently serve as a PR manager for <a href="http://www.maizemirchiofficial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maize Mirchi A Capella</a>.</p>
